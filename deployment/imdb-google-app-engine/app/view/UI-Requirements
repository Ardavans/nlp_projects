Requirements:
=============
1) The main page is as shown in the mockup. It has a textarea field and a button below it to take the user input.
2) Output information will be shown by a gauge and some text below it. 
3) The gauge should be displayed on the right side of the page. https://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Minimal-Gauge-Plugin-With-jQuery-CSS3-cmGauge/
4) It will have 3 labels, left side will be called 'Negative'. Right side 'Positive' and center is "Neutral". By default when the page loads it can be neutral.
5) Once user enters some text and clicks on 'Analyze' then the button should show "Loading" until the backend runs and returns the result. Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54522830/bootstrap-4-loading-spinner-in-button for how it should look.
6) Once the backend returns with 2 values, text is positive or negative along with a confidence value, set the gauge to the appropriate value.
7) For positive it will move towards the right and color of the gauge should be green.
8) For negative it will move towards the left and color of the gauge should be red.
9) In between the color can change in this manner: red--orange--yellow--green.

Some details:
1) The front-end HTML code to take user input is present in index.html file in this folder.
2) The backend return code is currently present in server.py file inside the 'app' folder (https://github.com/nikhilno1/nlp_projects/blob/master/deployment/imdb-google-app-engine/app/server.py)
3) Currently it returns simple HTML page with some text. That needs to be replaced with the gauge.
