Requirements:
=============
1) The main page is as shown in the mockup. It has a textarea field and a button below it to take the user input.
2) Output information will be shown by a gauge and some text below it. 
3) The gauge should be displayed on the right side of the page. https://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Minimal-Gauge-Plugin-With-jQuery-CSS3-cmGauge/
4) It will have 3 labels, left side will be called 'Negative'. Right side 'Positive' and center is "Neutral". By default when the page loads it can be neutral.
5) Once user enters some text and clicks on 'Analyze' then the button should show "Loading" until the backend runs and returns the result. Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54522830/bootstrap-4-loading-spinner-in-button for how it should look.
6) The backend returns 2 values, a number 0 or 1 that indicates whether the sentiment is positive or negative (0: negative, 1: positive). And a confidence value that indicates how confident it is.
7) For positive sentiment it should move towards the right and color of the gauge should be green.
8) For negative sentiment it should move towards the left and color of the gauge should be red.
9) In between the color can change in this manner: red--orange--yellow--green.

Some details:
1) The front-end HTML code to take user input is present in index.html file in this folder.
2) The backend return code is currently present in server.py file inside the 'app' folder (https://github.com/nikhilno1/nlp_projects/blob/master/deployment/imdb-google-app-engine/app/server.py)
3) Currently it returns simple HTML page with some text. That needs to be replaced with the gauge.
